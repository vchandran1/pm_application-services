Steps to run Services application
Prerequisites
1.	NodeJS v 10.x installed or available

Setup
1.	Clone or download both the code from repo - https://github.com/vchandran1/pm_application-ui
2.	Run npm install
3.	Run npm start
By default, this will try to connect to localhost:9001 for services. If we have services deployed onto a different host/port, please update the corresponding host/port in setupProxy.js (https://github.com/vchandran1/pm_application-ui/blob/master/src/setupProxy.js) and then run “npm start”
